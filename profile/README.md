# Cloudonix Mobile SDK - Sample Applications

Here you can find a set of mobile applications and server components that will help you get started with
building products using the Cloudonix Platform.

## Samples:

 - [example-dialer-swift5](example-dialer-swift5): An iOS SIP soft phone written in Swift 5.
 - [cloudonix-sample-android-reg-free-dialer](cloudonix-sample-android-reg-free-dialer): An Android Registration-Free VoIP sample.
 - [cloudonix-sample-reg-free-server](cloudonix-sample-reg-free-server): A sample Registration-Free backend written for Node.JS.
   This sample service (or another implementation of the [Cloudonix Registration-Free Protocol](https://docs.cloudonix.io/#/platform/registration-free/))
   is needed to run all of the Registration-Free sample applications.
